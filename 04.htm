<br>Subject: Re: Lynx <a href="0103.htm">Download</a> Cable
<br>
<br>
<br>Yes a cable does exist. however, due to the security and design of
the lynx, you simply can't upload to the lynx and expect it to work.
the cable works in conjuction with a special Rom Cart( bastian stick
design it :) ),, this cart exploits a bug in a loader of one of the
lynx's game (gauntlet) this bug allows the lynx, to load, a hacked
booter with a direct connect program tacked on to it.
<br>
</p>
<p>the rom cart, allows the lynx to expect an upload so to speak.
With this setup you are limited to the main memory of the lynx, which
is 64k, however realisticly with all the lynx's overhead and the bll
loader this is really around 56k or something...
<br>
</p>
<p>you could build the stuff required yourself, but you would need
access to a romburner, and you would need to find a suitable lynx rom
prototype cart also, this allows you to use standard rom dips.
<br>
</p>
<p>With the above setup, you would plug the 232 to lynxcom converter
to a pc and the other end to the multiplayer port, insert the special
lynx cart set the port speed, write a program in cc65 use the special
uploader Sendpc or pc2lynx, and then with the lynx on, your program
would be transfered to the lynx, and load up.
<br>
</p>
<p>it takes seconds to send you code to the lynx.
<br>
</p>
<p>another way to get your stuff on the lynx, still requires a
romburner. but it has the advantage of using all the available lynx
ram, and all the rom :). to do this you would need a Atari St computer
or pascifast the Atari ST emulator, then you get Bastain's Development
kill BLL. this kit has a lynx devolopers program, ( i haven't gotten
around to playing with this due to school) however, you Write your
code compile it, then run it through a rom builder, you choose your
rom carts size 128 512 etc, and the program tacts a boot loader to
your program, which is rom burner ready, (this is the get around for
the encrypted booter on the lynx) then you burn the code to the
approprate chip and bang your in business.
<br>
</p>
<p>i've been after bastain to make a pc version of BLL but well we
need to give him more encoragment :)
<br>
</p>
<p>well hopefully this clears up some some question, and as always
creates more, :)
<br>go to http://rghx54.gp.fht-esslingen.de/students/elw5basc/
<br>
<br>i'm also coming up with a quick tutorial on how to program the
lynx with examples, but again i haven't had time latly so this is
currently on halt :(.
<br>
<br>its going to be at http://www.qc.edu/&nbsp;f5rqc you'll see the link.
<br>
<br>this will get you started on your way,, i bought some of the
special carts about 3 months ago and have been happy ever since :)
<br>
</p>
<p>good luck everybody,
<br>look for my games for the lynx soon*
<br>
</p>
<p>*soon as i have time to make them :P.

<p>P.s. schematic for the 232 to lynx converter are on his page, it
requires a 232max chip and some capasitors :)...
